## Understanding Prescription Medications and Medication Labels

A prescription is a written order by a licensed health care professional for the preparation and use of a medication. Only licensed health care professionals may

prescribe medications. They include:

Medical Physician or Psychiatrist (MD)

Osteopathic Physician (DO)

Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN)

Physician Assistant (PA)

Dentist (DDS or DMD)

Optometrist (OD)

Podiatrist (DPM)

You may see "prescription" written as "Rx.

## After a client is discharged from an inpatient, emergency, or urgent care facility (including psychiatric)

When a client is discharged from any facility, whether it is inpatient, rehab, psychiatric emergency room, or any other they will usually have new medication orders. It is very important to the client's safety that these orders are reconciled with the client's current medication orders, You must call the client's primary care provider within 24 hours to reconcile the client's current medication orders with the orders provided on discharge from the facility. You must document that you made the call, and the response from the primary care provider including all instructions for medication and follow-up care. If you do not get a response from the provider, you must document that, along with all continued attempts to contact the provider.

If there is no nurse there to take verbal instructions from the primary care provider, you ar required to ask the provider for faxed or electronically supplied instructions.

Clients may take as regularly scheduled medications - low-dose aspirin, vitamins, stomach drugs like Prilosec are examples. OTCs are frequently used as PRNs. Tylenol, ibuprofen, Colace, cough syrups, medicated ointments are common PRN OTCS. Group homes, ADTs, and supported living arrangements with more than one client may keep stock supplies of OTCs for the use of more than one client. OTCs do not have to be labeled by a pharmacist, but require an order from health care practitioner, which must be followed exactly.

## Controlled Medication

Controlled medications are divided into five "Schedules," Schedule I through Schedule V.

Abuse potential is considered to be highest with Schedule I drugs (which have no currently accepted medical use in the U.S.), with only limited abuse potential for

Schedule V drugs.

Examples:

Schedule II: Ritalin, Codeine, Fentanyl, Oxycodone, morphine

Schedule IV: Phenobarbital, Valium, Ativan, Klonopin

Controlled medications must be double-locked and counted as required by 65G-7.007(5)
